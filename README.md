# AI-comment-classifier
An ML-powered classifier to distinguish between human-generated and AI-generated comments on social media, using machine learning techniques for accurate detection and analysis

## Overview
This project is designed to classify social media comments as either human-generated or AI-generated. Using machine learning techniques, the classifier aims to accurately distinguish between the two types of content, focusing on key text features and model evaluation metrics.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and prepares text data for model training.
- **Modeling**: Implements a logistic regression model for binary classification.
- **Evaluation**: Utilizes precision, recall, F1-score, and other metrics to evaluate model performance.

## Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AI-Comment-Classifier.git
   cd AI-Comment-Classifier
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. **Prepare your dataset:** 
   - Ensure your data is in a CSV format with the appropriate labels (human-generated or AI-generated).

2. **Run the model:**
   - Use the provided scripts to train the model on your dataset.
   - Evaluate the results using the included evaluation functions.

3. **Example Command:**
   ```bash
   python train_model.py --data data/comments.csv
   ```
